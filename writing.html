	                            <h2>The Restaurant</h2>
                                <p>‘Hello, Mr., this is from the...’ the shocking news come from the other side of phone have startled him to drop the phone onto the floor. The dropping sound of the phone breaks the moment of silence in the restaurant. Everyone in the restaurant stare at him like something bad would happened if he makes another noise to disturb them. He tries to calm down himself and acts like normal.</p>
                            <p>Today is the fifth anniversary of their marriage, so he reserved a table in this posh restaurant in Central like he always did in the past four years. This is where he asked her to be his girlfriend, this is where he proposed to her, and so they made it to be the place that they visit every year to commemorate their love.</p>
                            <p>' 2 for Mr. Wong please.’ He enters the restaurant and tells the waiter. ‘A dinner special for 2 please, and serve the dinner after my wife arrive.’ He orders the food right after he sits down, like he is a patron of this restaurant. ‘OK, Sir, would you care for a drink?’ ‘Two iced lemon tea, she loves it,’ he adds.</p>
                            <p>He takes out the book she gave him yesterday, which was a gift for their anniversary, and starts to read it. He promised her to finish the book in a week and tell her what it is about while she was leaning her head on his chest. He opens the book to chapter 1, and steeps in a world that only he and the book are left. ‘Knock, knock,’ a sudden hitting sound on the table arouses him from the absorption with the book. ‘Enjoy reading it, huh?’ she seems to arrive for a while and tries to bring him back to the real world. ‘You must be hungry after work, I have already order our food,’ he comes back to himself and tells her with a low voice. ‘Happy fifth anniversary,’ she grips his hands and looks through his eyes. This scene, this moment, happened every year since they were together. He lapses into the memories they created for the past few years.</p>
                            <p>They love each other very much, they cherish their love like you treasure your breath when you are dying of suffocation. He met her in high school, she was the chairman of the student union, and he was the secretary in the student union. He was always attracted by her easy-going personality, the childish and cheerful smile. When the year of student union service came to an end, he spoke up to her, brought her to this restaurant and asked her to be his girlfriend. Her cheeks turned all rosy and replied with a captivating smile, then they spent their first date in this posh restaurant.</p>
                            <p>‘What takes them so long to serve the dishes? I have told them to serve when you arrive,’ he wondered. He called the waiter to serve the appetizers, ‘Sir, I thought you said…’ ‘Just bring up the appetizers, please. We are hungry.’ He stopped the waiter and ordered him. ‘OK…’ the waiter goes away with doubt on his face. ‘Wait for a little more time, they will serve the appetizers soon.’ He pets her hands and says.</p>
                            <p>They saw each other for the rest of the university years, sweetly, every friends around them were sure they would get married very soon. When he finished his Degree in psychiatric profession, he brought her to this restaurant again and proposed to her, he held her hands tight, gazed her and said, ‘I know we are still young, but deep inside my heart, I know you are the one,’ He knelt down and took out the diamond ring from his pocket, it was old-style, but it worked. She replied him with a captivating smile, again, and jumped into his embrace, asking him not to leave her alone, ever. Soon, they walked down the aisle under the blessing of their families and friends.</p>
                            </div>
	                    <div class="col-md-4 text-justify">
	                        <p>‘I ordered a lemon tea for myself, I will give it a try,’ he looked at the glass of the iced lemon tea like strangers. The drops of melting ices on the surface of the glass fall like an elderly strolls around in the park. He watches the lemon pieces on top of the tea float and sink and float, like a ship swaying in a small wave. He grasps the glass and takes a sip of the iced lemon tea from the straw, and puts it back on the table, ‘It is better than I thought it would be.’ He smiled.</p>
                            <p>It was the third time they came to the restaurant, and it's also the first anniversary of their marriage. That was the first time they visited the restaurant after they had married. They ordered a dinner special for 2, and held each other's hands to tell how much they love each other. They recalled the scene that he proposed, that she replied yes.  ‘Would you care for a drink?’ ‘Iced lemon tea for me, and hot milk tea for him, please.’ She answered. He wasn't a big fan to lemon tea.</p>
                            <p>‘Try the house salad, it is quite good!’ He says gently. ‘No, it is fine, I am not in the mood of having salad today,’ she answers gloomily. He can feel the sorrow inside her, the disheartenment emits by her is like someone who is prosecuted of murder and sent to jail cell. He stops talking and looks at her... She gazes him with a sadness in her eyes, like she is going to leave him.</p>
                            <p>It was the second anniversary they spent to each other, in this restaurant, again. They ordered the dinner special for 2, like what they did last year. An iced lemon tea, a hot milk tea and the appetizers were then served on the table, the appetizer was a fruit salad with shrimps. She pulled the salad to her front, and started to pick out the shrimps, when she finished, she pushed the salad towards him quietly. He was allergic to shrimps.</p>
                            <p>The waiter takes away the dishes, the finished one and also the salad that is untouched. "The new decoration of this restaurant is nice, the mood is even more sentimental under the dim lights," he tries to open new topic to discuss. "Do you love this new mood? It can be our new start..."</p>
                            <p>It was the fifth time they were here, to celebrate their third anniversary. The restaurant renovated the design every three years to attract more new customers, and that was the year the restaurant redecorate the design. ‘I love the new design. The mood is very bright, I am feeling jubilant!’ She said merrily. Again, she gave a childish and cheerful smile to him which melted his heart like an ice cream melting into milkshake, just like high school.</p>
                            <p>‘Why don't you eat anything?’ He suppresses his emotion and asks. ‘Why are you being so quiet tonight? Is it because of me? Forgive me, OK? You said we can never leave each other, never!’ He starts talking louder and louder. ‘I am sorry, but I have to leave you behind.’ She says with tears dropping down from her eyes. He looks at her and stops talking, he puts his hands on her face and wipes off the tears from her face.</p>
                            <p>It was the day of their fourth anniversary, she wasn't feeling well. She was sick for the past few days, and lately she was vomiting and having headache. But it was the anniversary, so she insisted to go to the restaurant to have dinner. He looked at her the whole night with worries in his eyes, but she continued eating like normal. After they finished the meal and was going to leave the restaurant, she suddenly fainted down…</p>
                            <p>‘Sir, is your wife coming? Do you want me to serve the main dishes?’ The waiter asks carefully. ‘Serve them, my wife didn't like the salad you just served. Can't you see she is starving right now?’ He answers in a steady tone. ‘OK...’ The waiter answers with frighten in his eyes, he takes a look on the empty chair besides him and leaves the table. ‘Let’s wait for a couple of moments, you must be starving.’ He says to her calmly.</p>
                            </div>
	                    <div class="col-md-4 text-justify">
                            <p>The next few days, she was lying on bed, letting him to take care of her. She was pregnant for three months, it had been most gratifying of all the things happened. He put his hand on her belly, ‘Oh, you are the gift God gives us to witness our love.’ He caressed her belly lovingly. For the following months, she had been staying at home and he had been working very hard outside. After 7 months, the baby girl was born, and everything was very pleasurable.</p>
                            <p>‘It is already the fifth anniversary, we should do something special!’ He says. ‘I am sorry, but this is the last one we can celebrate…’ ‘Why?’ ‘You should let go, move on…’ she speaks softly. ‘No, I am not letting you go!’</p>
                            <p>It was the fifth anniversary of their marriage, she was excited to spend the seventh time with him in the same restaurant, and she couldn’t wait to see him. ‘I want this on my desk within today,’ a file appeared on her desk, it was her horrid boss, giving her a late work to do just before she could call it a day. She finished the work very fast, but it was already 7 p.m.</p>
                            <p>She rushed to the taxi stand to catch a taxi, ‘Drop me off in front of the cake shop opposite to the mall in central.’ ‘I am in a hurry. Can you speed up?’ She added. When she got off the taxi, she ran to the cake shop to buy the blue berry cheese cake and got out of the shop quickly. When she came to the road, she saw no signs of cars passing through it, so she crossed the road under the red light.</p>
                            <p>The waiter comes to the manager and tells the manager what he saw. ‘It is terrifying, he is speaking to the air.’ ‘Maybe he is thinking aloud, just leave it!’ ‘No, he is talking to “someone” apparently, he asked me whether I can see his wife!’ The waiter really freaks out by him talking to his wife and observes him.</p>
                            <p>‘Beep, Beep… Smash!’ a sudden series of sound was heard across the road between the mall and the cake shop. A car crashes across the road, several people were injured. ‘Nee-naw, nee-naw…’ after a while, sirens of ambulances had covered up the whole area of Central.</p>
                            <p>‘Mr., are you still there? I am very sorry for your lost. But we hope you can come as soon as possible to help us identify Sally Wan’s, your wife’s body…’ voice from the other side of the phone, which already dropped on the floor, keeps speaking for the past 5 minutes.</p>
                            <p>‘Sorry, I am late.’ She comes in and sits down on the chair, ‘I tried to call you, but your phone was jammed with another line.’ ‘There was a car crush outside, and I almost got killed by a car. I should have listen to you, not to cross the road under red lights.’ ‘What happened? Why are you acting so weird?’ She asks with puzzled. ‘Hey, I am here! And guess what? I bought you your favorite, blueberry cheese cake!’</p>
                            <p>She picks up the phone on the floor and hangs off the phone. ‘Sir and madam, here are your main dishes.’ The waiter comes with the prepared main dishes and puts them down.</p>

                 <center><h2>Revenge from Neverland</h2>
                    <h4>Chapter 1 - The First Hunt</h4></center>
                    <p>It’s been 5 years since the day I left the land. I was supposed to live a new life, but I never gave up on my vengeance. I had sworn to the remains of Wendy that I will slaughter him with my own hands after I find the portal to get back…</p>
                    <p>I looked at the mirror after I got up. I am still getting older and older as usual. The only unusual thing is, I dreamt of Michael last night. He told me the only way to come back is to find “her”.</p>
                    <p>I got in a carriage and headed towards the palace. The notices of finding the princess were found everywhere. The princess was gone missing for 2 months, the whole kingdom is in panic, except me, the only thing I care is revenge.</p>
                    <p>I got to the castle where she lives in. I avoided the soldiers, and sneaked into her room. She was looking at me in the reflection of her mirror.</p>
                    <p>"Your majesty." I bowed down immediately.</p>
                    <p>"Any request?" seemed like she knew I was coming to her.</p>
                    <p>I told her everything and asked for her favor. "I love vengeance, but you know, magic always comes with a price. Help me kill snow and I will give you whatever you want." The queen was my only hope, so there was only one choice left, killing the princess.</p>
                    <p>I took the weapon from the queen and got into the forest for my first human hunt. According to the mirror, the princess was living with seven dwarfs. So I spent an afternoon cutting trees along the lake besides their house. The dwarfs saw my hard work, so they came and gave help for the sake of the kindness of Princess Snow. So when they were busy about helping me, I got away without their notice.</p>
                    <p>I sneaked into their house. Snow White was sleeping in peace, I pulled out the magical dagger that the queen gave me, and stabbed into the princess’ heart. The royal blood of the princess spurted onto my face. I took out the heart and the sound of the dripping of blood was exceptionally clear…</p>

                 <h2>Truth Behind Madness Douglass</h2>
                    <h4>Narrating an ending of a story with picture</h4>
                    <p>Countless days alone in the study, yet seemed to be meeting someone. I knew something’s up with him. We told Madam that Sir Douglass was having “visitors” after we eavesdropped on his “conversations” at the study. We explained to her that the 5 Englishmen he always blathered on about were actually all his imaginations, and told her everything “they” were telling Sir Douglass. Madam was shocked and thought Sir Douglass met something supernatural.</p>
                    <p>Madam warned us to keep our mouth shut, she did not want others to judge the Douglass and damage Sir Douglass’s reputation. She found every well-known priests she could ever ask for to help expel the “filthy demons” surrounding Sir Douglass, but none of them were able to remove the hallucinations for him. After two months, Madam almost spent all the money on those deceivers, so she turned to the Douglass’ last hope, medical treatments; despite her history with these professionals.</p>
                    <p>There he was, lying on bed, claiming he is normal. The doctor said he was under a mental illness; he called it Schizophrenia, which was a word that did not appear in my dictionary until then. The conversations between Sir Douglass and his imaginations proved his tendency to self-mutilation, so the doctor recommended force-treatment for Sir Douglass’s situation, but the expenses would be at high cost. Madam said she would give up everything for Sir Douglass, so she dismissed us and packed the Douglass’ belongings. From that day onwards, none of us had ever seen or heard from the Douglass; and the Douglass remained noble to people.</p>

                 <h2>The Barber</h2>
                    <h4>Model Writing based on The Lover by Marguerite Duras</h4>
                    <p>Outside it’s the end of the day, you can tell by the moment of silence, the sound of less and less friction between the passers-by and the ground, more and more shutting gate. It’s a community of peace and silence. And mid-night is beginning now, with the moon hanging high above this big well. The hair salon is separated from the community by those noise from the hair dryers, that pungent smell cause by the tint. Whiffs of aroma drift into my nose, the smell of the hair conditioner, purfume from the old lady lying besides me, scorching smell of the overburnt hair dryer.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly a man taps my shoulder. I was able to take a nap when I have my hair washed. The barber taps my shoulder to signify me for my hair cut. I get up and follow him to the chair he pulls for me. He must be a newbie in the salon, I never recognised his face, but it’s OK to give it a try. He says nothing. He rubs my hair with a towel and takes out the hair dryer from his workstation and starts to dry my hair. I guess he is really a green hand, maybe he's just trying to get his job done a little bit quicker, but he really does burn my scalp. After the roasted scalp, he takes out the scissors and asks me a couple of questions. I can see threads of my hair drop to the floor, I can hear the heavy breathing of him clearly. I can feel the nervousness inside him, like I am the appraisal for his job.</p>
                    <p>It takes me an hour to finish my hair cut which I usually wouldn’t take so long. He collects my money and exhales a deep breath, he is relieved, so am I. The silence of the community getting more and more deep, and follow by the closing of the hair salon, a new morning is yet to come.</p>
